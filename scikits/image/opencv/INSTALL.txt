You can use the setup.py in this directory to build ONLY the OpenCV stuff.

It is recommend that you use the main setup.py for the entire scikit. 

To install globally::

  python setup.py install

To install locally::

  python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}

  # Remember to add /home/user/lib/python2.x/lib/site-packages
  # to your PYTHONPATH

To compile in-place::

  python setup.py build_ext -i
