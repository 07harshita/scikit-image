You can try to use the setup.py but it may still be broken

Until we come to a solution for a setup.py, execute the included shell script build.sh and copy the .so's to wherever you want them

scikit/image/opencv$./build.sh
scikit/image/opencv$cd tests
scikit/image/opencv/tests$python test_opencv_cv.py

!* make sure the scikits directory is on the python path *!
