def cut_threshold(labels, rag, thresh):
    """Combine regions seperated by weight less than threshold.

    Given an image's labels and its RAG, output new labels by
    combining regions whose nodes are seperated by a weight less
    than the given threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : ndarray
        The array of labels.
    rag : RAG
        The region adjacency graph.
    thresh : float
        The threshold. Regions connected by edges with smaller weights are
        combined.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The new labelled array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skimage import data, graph, segmentation
    >>> img = data.lena()
    >>> labels = segmentation.slic(img)
    >>> rag = graph.rag_mean_color(img, labels)
    >>> new_labels = graph.cut_threshold(labels, rag, 10)
