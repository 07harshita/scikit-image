How to make a new release of ``scikits.image``
==============================================

- Update the version number in setup.py and commit
- Update the docs and api, push upstream using the "push_github" script
- Add the version number as a tag in git::

  git tag v0.1

- Push the new meta-data to github::

  git push --tags origin master

- Publish on PyPi:

  python setup.py register

- Ideally, the step above would be replaced by

  python setup.py sdist upload

  but this doesn't work at the moment.

- Increase the version number in the setup.py file to ``0.2dev``.
